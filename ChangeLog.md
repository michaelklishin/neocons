## Changes between Neocons 1.1.0 and 2.0.0-beta1

### Clojure 1.3 Support Dropped

Neocons no longer supports Clojure 1.3.

### Transaction Support (Neo4J Server 2.0)

Neocons 2.0 gains support for [transactions](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-transactional.html).


#### Higher Level API

A group of Cypher statements can be executed in a transaction
that will be committed automatically upon success. Any error
during the execution will trigger a rollback.

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction :as tx])

(tx/in-transaction
  (tx/statement "CREATE (n {props} RETURN n)" {:props {:name "Node 1"}})
  (tx/statement "CREATE (n {props} RETURN n)" {:props {:name "Node 2"}}))
```

#### Lower Level API

Transactions are instantiated from a group of Cypher statements
that are passed as maps to `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction/begin`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction :as tx])

(let [[t _] (tx/begin [{:statement "CREATE (n {props}) RETURN n" :props {:name "My node"}}])]
  (tx/commit t))

(let [[t _] (tx/begin)]
  (tx/rollback t))
```

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction/commit` and
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction/rollback` commit
and roll a transaction back, respectively.

#### Macro for working with a transaction

If you want a more fine grained control of working in a transaction without manually
committing or checking for exceptions, you can use the
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction/with-transaction` macro.

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.transaction :as tx])

(let [transaction (tx/begin-tx)]
  (tx/with-transaction
    transaction
    true
    (let [[_ result] (tx/execute transaction [(tx/statement "CREATE (n) RETURN ID(n)")])]
    (println result))))
```

If there any errors while processing, the transaction is rolled back.

The first argument is the variable which holds the transaction information. The second argument to the macro is `commit-on-success`, which commits the transaction there are no errors.

## Changes between Neocons 1.1.0-beta4 and 1.1.0

### ClojureWerkz Support Upgrade

Neocons now uses ClojureWerkz Support 0.15.0.

### Clojure 1.5 By Default

Neocons now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.5.0`. It is
still compatible with Clojure 1.3+ and if your `project.clj` depends on
a different version, it will be used, but 1.5 is the default now.

We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.5, it is a drop-in replacement
for the majority of projects out there.

### Cheshire 5.x

Neocons now uses [Cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire) 5.x.


## Changes between Neocons 1.1.0-beta3 and 1.1.0-beta4

### Improved URI Path Encoding

Keys with colons are now handled correctly (as of Urly `2.0.0-alpha5`).



## Changes between Neocons 1.1.0-beta2 and 1.1.0-beta3

### Correct URI Path Encoding

Neocons now correctly encodes all parts of URIs, which means
index keys and values can contain whitespace and Unicode
characters, for example.

GH issue: #20

### clj-http upgraded to 0.6.4

Neocons now uses clj-http 0.6.4.

### Support upgraded to 0.12.0

Neocons now uses ClojureWerkz Support 0.12.0.



## Changes between Neocons 1.1.0-beta1 and 1.1.0-beta2

### Support upgraded to 0.10.0

Neocons now uses ClojureWerkz Support 0.10.0.


### clj-http upgraded to 0.6.3

Neocons now uses clj-http 0.6.3.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationship/maybe-create Now Fully Supports Ids

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationship/maybe-create` now correctly works with node ids
as well as `Node` records.

GH issue: #19.

### More Informative Exceptions

HTTP exceptions bubbling up now will carry more information (namely the response `:body`).

Contributed by Adrian Gruntkowski.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/get-many

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/get-many` is a new function that fetches multiple relationships
by id in a single request:

```clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships :as rel])

(rel/get-many [id1 id2 id3])
```

Contributed by Adrian Gruntkowski.


## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0 and 1.1.0-beta1

### Initial Spatial Plugin Support

Neocons now has initial support for the Neo4J Spatial plugin in the `clojurewerkz.neocons.spatial`
namespace.

Contributed by Kyle Goodwin.


### Cheshire For JSON Serliazation

Neocons now uses (and depends on) [Cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire) for JSON serialization.
[clojure.data.json](https://github.com/clojure/data.json) is no longer a dependency.

### Clojure 1.4 By Default

Neocons now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.4.0`. It is still compatible with Clojure 1.3 and if your `project.clj` depends
on 1.3, it will be used, but 1.4 is the default now.

We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.4, it is a drop-in replacement for the majority of projects out there.


### Pass Configuration When Creating Node Indexes

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/create-index` now correctly passes index configuration
to Neo4J Server. Reported in #6.


### clj-http upgraded to 0.5.5

Neocons now uses clj-http 0.5.5.



## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-rc3 and 1.0.0

### Better support for unique graph entities

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/create-unique-in-index` and `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/create-unique-in-index` are
two functions that create a node (relationship) and add it to an index while ensuring entry uniqueness atomically.


Contributed by Zhemin Lin.


## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-rc2 and 1.0.0-rc3

### Generic batch operation support

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.batch/perform` allows for executing any sequence of operations in batch using [Neo4J REST API for batch operations](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-batch-ops.html):

``` clojure
(ns clojurewerkz.neocons.examples
  (:require [clojurewerkz.neocons.rest               :as neorest]
            [clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.batch         :as b]))

(neorest/connect! "http://localhost:7474/db/data/")

(let [ops [{:method "POST"
                     :to     "/node"
                     :body   {}
                     :id     0}
                    {:method "POST"
                     :to     "/node"
                     :body   {}
                     :id     1}
                    {:method "POST",
                     :to     "{0}/relationships",
                     :body   {:to   "{1}"
                              :data {}
                              :type "knows"}
                     :id     2}]
               res (doall (b/perform ops))]
           (println res))
```

This is a relatively low level function. It is reasonable to expect an easier to use way of executing batch operations
in future versions of Neocons.


### Batch creation of nodes

A new function, `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/create-batch`, can be used to efficiently insert a large number of nodes
at the same time (up to hundreds of thousands or millions).

It returns a lazy sequence of results, which both makes it more memory efficient and may require forcing the evaluation
with `clojure.core/doall` in some cases.


### Unique indexes and graph entities

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/create-index` now accepts a new configuration option: `:unique`, which makes
the index unique (that allows/guarantees only one entry per key).

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/create-index` works the same way.

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/add-to-index` and
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/add-to-index` now take an additional (optional) argument that, when set to true,
will add the entity to the index [as unique](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-unique-indexes.html)


## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-rc1 and 1.0.0-rc2

### Support for indexes over relationships

This include `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/create-index`, `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/add-to-index`
and other functions that are `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes` counterparts but for relationships.

Thanks to Neo4J Server's consistent REST API, indexes support for relationships is almost identical to that on nodes.



## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-beta4 and 1.0.0-rc1

### Documentation guides

We started working on documentation guides for Neocons at [clojureneo4j.info](http://clojureneo4j.info)


## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-beta3 and 1.0.0-beta4

### More robust relationships/create

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/create` is now more robust and handles cases when given nodes
may only have `:id` set on them. This may happen in part a regression and in part because of edge cases
in the REST API in our own code.


### clj-http upgraded to 0.4.0

Neocons now uses clj-http 0.4.0.


## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-beta2 and 1.0.0-beta3

### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/find-one

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/find-one` finds a single node in an index. Supposed to be used with
unique indexes.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/replace-outgoing

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/replace-outgoing` deletes outgoing relationships of a certain
type on a node and creates new relationships of the same type with another set of nodes.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/destroy-many

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/destroy-many` is a new function that destroys multiple nodes using
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/destroy`


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/destroy

A new function that purges all node relationships and immediately deletes the node using `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/delete`.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/delete-many

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/delete-many` deletes multiple relationships using
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/delete`.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/delete-many

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/delete-many` is a new function that deletes multiple nodes using
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/delete`. For a node to be deleted, it must have no relationships.

To purge all node relationships and immediately delete the node, use `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/destroy`.


### clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/delete, /update, /set-property are now polymorphic

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/delete`, `/update` and `/set-property` are now polymorhic: they accept
both `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.record.Node` instances and node ids as longs.


### rest.nodes/multi-get is renamed to rest.nodes/get-many

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/multi-get` has been renamed to `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/get-many` to be consistent with
similar functions in other namespaces. `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/multi-get` is not yet removed (for ease of upgrading)
but is deprecated and will be removed completely in the future.


### Relationship record fields renamed

Two `Relationship` record fields were renamed to match REST API responses better:

 * `:start-uri` is now `:start`
 * `:end-uri` is now `:end`


### rest.relationships/starts-with?, rest.relationships/ends-with?

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/starts-with?` and `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/ends-with?` predicates check whether
given relationships starts (or ends, respectively) with a node with the given id. This is often useful
for automated testing of logic that creates relationships.


### rest.cypher/empty?

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.cypher/empty?` is a new function that can be used to tell empty Cypher responses from
non-empty ones.


### rest.relationships/create-many, rest.relationships/maybe-delete

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/create-many` is a new function that creates multiple relationships
from one node to several other nodes. All relationships will be of the same type. Relationships
are created concurrently using [clojure.core/pmap](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/pmap). As a consequence, this function is supposed
to be used when number of relationships created is in dozens, hundreds of thousands.

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.relationships/maybe-delete` is a new function that deletes a relationship if that exists and does nothing
otherwise.


### clj-http upgraded to 0.3.6

Neocons now uses clj-http 0.3.6.



## Changes between Neocons 1.0.0-beta1 and 1.0.0-beta2

### HTTP Authentication support

Neocons now supports basic HTTP authentication. Credentials can be passed to `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.connect` and
`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.connect!` functions as well as via `NEO4J_LOGIN` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` environment variables
(to be Heroku-friendly).


### neocons.rest.connect and neocons.rest.connect! no longer accept java.net.URI instances

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.connect` and `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.connect!` no longer accept java.net.URI instances. Please use strings from now on.
This makes implementation of HTTP authentication and Heroku add-on support much simpler at a price of this small
undocumented feature.


### clj-http upgraded to 0.3.4

Neocons now uses clj-http 0.3.4.


### cypher/tableize and cypher/tquery

New function `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.cypher/tableize` transforms Cypher query responses (that list columns and row sets separately) into tables,
much like SQL queries do. The following test demonstrates how it works:

``` clojure
(deftest ^{:cypher true} test-tableize
  (let [columns ["x.name" "x.age"]
        rows    [["John" 27] ["Sarah" 28]]]
    (is (= [{"x.name" "John" "x.age" 27}
            {"x.name" "Sarah" "x.age" 28}] (vec (cy/tableize columns rows))))))
```

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.cypher/tquery` combines `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.cypher/query` and `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.cypher/tableize`: it executes Cypher queries and returns results
formatted as table.


### More Efficient nodes/connected-out

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/connected-out` implementation is now based on `clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/multi-get` and is much more efficient for nodes
with many outgoing relationships.


### nodes/multi-get

`clojurewerkz.neocons.rest.nodes/multi-get` function efficiently (in a single HTTP request) fetches multiple nodes by id.
It implemented on top of the [Cypher query language](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.6/cypher-query-lang.html) and thus requires Neo4J Server 1.6.0 or later.


### Leiningen 2

Neocons now uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading).
