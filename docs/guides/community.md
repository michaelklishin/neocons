## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, poor default, missing feature or find any part of the API inconvenient, please [file an issue](https://github.com/michaelklishin/neocons/issues) on Github.
If possible, try to explain what behavior you expected and why. Bonus points for contributing failing test cases.


## Contributing

Neocons uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make sure you have it installed and then run tests against
supported Clojure versions using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request
on Github.
